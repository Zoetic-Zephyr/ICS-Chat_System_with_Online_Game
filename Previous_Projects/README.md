# References for the Presentation Project

#### There are a few things you need to consider in the final presentation project:

- Choosing a topic for your team
- What is the goal of your project
- What is the framework for your code 
- Making up a demo for your project
- The possible improvements

And, some works done by the former students can be found in this Repo, just for your reference. :smiley:
